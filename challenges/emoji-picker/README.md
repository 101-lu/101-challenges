# Create a responsive EmojiPicker in react

|> DEMO: https://challenges.101.lu/ <|

Your component does not need to look or match the demo 100%. You very likley won't finish in less than 1h and try and get as far
as you can, and maybe explain your thought process. Adapt the App component how you see fit.

- src/static/emojis.json contains categorized emojis including keywords for each one
- The emoji data or your component should be lazy loaded when the component mounts. Show an appropriate loading state
- Render the emojis by category like in the demo, with categories at the top that should scroll you to the right category on click
- Aria label the emojis correctly
- Add a search to filter emojis by the keywords and name
- Try to keeping the search fast by reducing the amount of emojis rendered during typing

If you have time:

- Keep track of most used emojis using any Storage interface (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) provided to
  the component. Do not update the rendered list while the component is mounted to prevent shifts while using the component, only
  after it was reopened or in the case of localStorage the site was refreshed.

If you have more time (kinda more difficult):

- Add keyboard accessibility/navigation insdie the emoji grid like in the demo: https://challenges.101.lu/demo.mp4
